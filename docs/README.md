## Why we made this:
* To create a welcoming community where users can post beautiful photographs
and share amazing bicycle rides in a given city!
* A beautiful way to store photos organized in albums that collect rides in a particular location. A single entry might include specific details about a location, tips on when to visit and directions. Creating an incredible database of travel guides organized by location.
* Go to site on the web for any cyclist planning their next ride! Be it planning the routes for an extended vacation or a pre workday  morning ride.
